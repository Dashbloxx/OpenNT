## About
Although this project was a plan to create a UNIX-like operating system, I've shifted my goal to create a NT-like kernel, for i386 processors. It's mostly for learning purposes, and I believe that I have gotten bored of wanting to write UNIX-like kernels, therefore (like I said) I plan on making this a kernel similar to the kernel behind Microsoft Windows.
